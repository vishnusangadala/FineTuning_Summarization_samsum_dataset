# **Fine-Tuning Summarization Model with Hugging Face**  

ðŸš€ **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a **text summarization model** using the **Samsum dataset**, which consists of messenger-like conversations paired with summaries. The model is trained with **Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, and PyTorch**, leveraging efficient techniques to improve summarization performance.  

## ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack & Dependencies**  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (Model fine-tuning)  
- **Hugging Face Datasets** (Dataset loading and preprocessing)  
- **PyTorch** (Deep learning framework)  
- **CUDA** (For GPU acceleration)  

## ðŸ›  **Setup & Installation**  
Ensure all required dependencies are installed:  
```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch accelerate
